          "An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods.",
          "An interface can only have abstract methods (before Java 8).",

          "Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods.",
          "Interfaces can have default methods in Java 8+.",
          "A class can implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit one abstract class."

        "correctAnswers": [
          "It can be used to declare constants.",
          "It can be used to prevent method overriding.",
          "It can be used to prevent inheritance of classes."
        ],
        "candidateResponses": [
          "Final can be used to declare constants.",
          "It prevents classes from being inherited and methods from being overridden.",
          "It is used to prevent variable modification."

        "id": 3,
        "questionText": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
        "correctAnswers": [
          "When a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the point that it negatively impacts the model's performance on new data.",
          "It typically happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount of training data."
        ],
        "candidateResponses": [
          "Overfitting occurs when the model memorizes the training data and fails to generalize."

        "questionText": "Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.",
        "correctAnswers": [
          "SQL databases are relational and use structured query language.",
          "NoSQL databases are non-relational and store data in various formats (like JSON, key-value pairs).",
          "SQL databases are best suited for structured data, while NoSQL is more flexible for unstructured data."
        ],
        "candidateResponses": [
          "SQL is relational and uses tables, while NoSQL uses documents or key-value stores.",
          "SQL is for structured data, NoSQL is better for handling unstructured data."
